# ShareDressUp

A tiny project, one that I was able to quickly review and prepare for publishing (I'm not sure I haven't broken anything, but everything seems to be in order)

I'm sorry, I planned that I would publish my code, initially I did it only for myself and always alone, so comments are rare. 

Unity 2021.2.5f1

Only portrait orientation (the game was planned for android)

The opening scene "Assets\Scenes\MainScene.unity"

"ShareDressUp\LocalePackages" - AdaSDK is my code (except  SimpleJSON and NativeShare). Usually this folder is not located in the project, but is shared by my projects. I moved it here so that the project could be launched without unnecessary movements.
