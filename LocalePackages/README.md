# Intro
Usually this folder is not located in the project, but is shared by my projects. I moved it here so that the project could be launched without unnecessary movements.

## About
I created different packages with basic scripts, so now I can create new projects without having to worry about porting existing code, like from a Lego. I never thought that I would show my code to anyone, so there are no comments there, sorry
